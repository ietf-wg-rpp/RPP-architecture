| R8.7   | RPP MUST support longer auth info, client software metadata, security events (RFC8807 equivalent)                          | **Not Fulfilled**       | Architecture does not specifically address longer authorization information, client software metadata, or security event information equivalent to Login Security Extension                                                  | N/A                                     | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/77                                                                                                              |
| R9.5   | All RPP communications MUST use HTTPS (TLS)                                                                                | **Not Fulfilled**       | Architecture does not explicitly mandate HTTPS/TLS. HTTP transport is defined but TLS encryption requirement not stated                                                                                                      | N/A                                     | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/78                                                                                                              |
| R9.14  | There MUST be mechanisms to revoke/deprecate credentials, tokens, or permissions                                           | **Not Fulfilled**       | Architecture does not explicitly define credential revocation mechanisms. OAuth 2.0 supports this but not stated in architecture                                                                                             | N/A                                     | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/79                                                                                                              |
| R9.16  | RPP MUST support registry operator impersonation/acting on behalf of any account with elevated access                      | **Not Fulfilled**       | Architecture does not address registry operator impersonation or elevated administrative access capabilities                                                                                                                 | N/A                                     | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/80                                                                                                              |
| R1.7   | RPP MUST support both Thin and Thick Registry models with flexibility in data storage/return                               | **Partially Fulfilled** | Architecture mentions flexibility in representations (Section 5.1.9) and varying response verbosity, but does not explicitly address Thin vs Thick Registry model distinctions                                               | Section 5.1.9, Section 5.2.1            | This vs. Thick Registry is the a data modelling aspect, on the level of resource type modelling (domain vs. contact). No additional need for requirements              |
| R3.6   | RPP MUST define pattern for resources addressable via multiple identifiers with one canonical and aliases                  | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.2.1 addresses IDN handling with redirects to canonical URLs or "see-also" linking, but does not define a complete general pattern for all resource types                                                         | Section 5.1.2.1                         | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/81                                                                                                              |
| R4.4   | RPP MUST have mechanism for defining/signaling profiles with identifiers describing required components, subsets, versions | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.15 defines profiles as identifiers for minimum configuration of protocol version, extensions, and versions, but does not fully detail how profiles describe required data model components or functional subsets | Section 5.1.15                          | The description is sufficient on the architecture level. It tells a profile might be machine readible but it can be also a generic description. Rest is in the design. |
| R4.6   | RPP MUST enforce strict validation, treating unknown properties/parameters/headers as errors                               | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.10 defines both strict and lenient processing modes via Prefer header, with lenient as **default**. This contradicts the MUST for strict validation, though strict mode is supported                             | Section 5.1.10, Section 5.2.3           | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/82                                                                                                              |
| R4.7   | RPP MUST support linking objects with flexible cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M) and links with attributes                       | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.2 mentions URL structures for related resources. Section 5.4 supports extension mechanisms. However, link attributes (e.g., contact role) are not explicitly addressed                                           | Section 5.1.2, Section 5.3              | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/83                                                                                                              |
| R4.8   | RPP MUST allow referencing shared objects sponsored by different clients while sponsor retains control                     | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.1.5 mentions object-level authorization with sponsors/owners having full control, but detailed shared object semantics are not specified                                                                         | Section 5.1.1.5                         | Section 5.1.1.5 specifies sufficiently object-level authorization with sponsors/owners having full control. The rest is design.                                        |
| R4.9   | RPP MUST support first-class, read-only resources managed by server, possibly with sub-resources                           | **Partially Fulfilled** | Architecture defines resources and sub-resources but does not explicitly define read-only server-managed resources as a distinct concept                                                                                     | Section 5.1.2, Section 5.1.4            | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/84                                                                                                              |
| R5.11  | RPP MUST support representation of collections of resources                                                                | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.2 mentions URL structures for lists. Section 4.1 mentions collection retrieval. No detailed collection representation specification                                                                              | Section 5.1.2, Section 4.1              | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/85                                                                                                              |
| R6.4   | RPP SHOULD support search for resource collections with filtering and pagination                                           | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.2 mentions URL structures for resource lists. Collection operations acknowledged but search, filtering, pagination details not specified                                                                         | Section 5.1.2, Section 4.1              | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/86                                                                                                              |
| R6.10  | RPP MUST support functional equivalent of EPP Poll command with possible enhancements                                      | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.11 mentions asynchronous processing with message queue resources for operation results, which could support polling. Explicit Poll equivalent not specified                                                      | Section 5.1.11                          | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/87                                                                                                              |
| R7.6   | Maintenance notices MAY be included in discovery document (human-readable)                                                 | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.17 describes discovery document for operational policies but does not explicitly mention maintenance notices                                                                                                     | Section 5.1.17                          | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/88                                                                                                              |
| R8.1   | RPP MUST provide functional equivalents for core EPP functionalities (domain, host, contact, org)                          | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 1 and 5.1.3 map EPP commands to HTTP methods. Architecture aims for functional equivalents but detailed mappings are for protocol specs                                                                              | Section 1, Section 5.1.3, Section 5.1.4 | This is OK so                                                                                                                                                          |
| R8.2   | Automatic/mechanical mapping/conversion between EPP and RPP data model MUST be possible                                    | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 1 states RPP "aims for data model compatibility with EPP core objects to allow automatic and mechanical mapping." Full mapping details are for protocol specs                                                        | Section 1, Section 5.2.1                | This is OK                                                                                                                                                             |
| R8.5   | EPP AuthInfo MUST be supported; RPP MUST support Secure Authorization for Transfer (RFC9154)                               | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.1.5 mentions "shared secrets for backward compatibility with EPP password-based authorisation" but does not specifically address RFC9154                                                                         | Section 5.1.1.5                         | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/89                                                                                                              |
| R9.4   | RPP MUST include authorization model beyond EPP AuthInfo (transfers without AuthInfo, registrant OpenID for DNS)           | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.1.2 mentions fine-grained authorization beyond auth-code models. Specific use cases like registrant-authorized DNS Operator access not detailed                                                                  | Section 5.1.1.2, Section 5.1.1.5        | 5.1.1.2. seems sufficient for an architecture document                                                                                                                 |
| R9.7   | RPP MAY include cryptographic verification of request/response messages                                                    | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.2.2 mentions JWT for "verifiable data consistency" and JWT-SD for selective disclosure, but not a full message signing framework                                                                                   | Section 5.2.2                           | https://github.com/ietf-wg-rpp/RPP-architecture/issues/90                                                                                                              |
| R9.10  | RPP MUST include considerations for secure credential handling (strong passwords, limited lifetime)                        | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.1.4 states security policies delegated to authentication schemes' best practices, not defined at protocol level. Addresses concern indirectly                                                                    | Section 5.1.1.4                         | 5.1.1.4. is sufficient.                                                                                                                                                |
| R9.12  | RPP MUST support secure credentials management (protection against replay/theft, limited lifetimes)                        | **Partially Fulfilled** | Section 5.1.1.4 delegates to authentication scheme best practices.
