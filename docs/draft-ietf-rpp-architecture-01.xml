<t anchor="_ac44b653-a95e-8347-ede7-a598155b4a5c">Advancements in development, integration, deployment environments and operational paradigms have led to a desire for an alternative for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP). This document defines the architecture for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) an HTTP based provisioning protocol leveraging the REST architectural style and JSON data-interchange format, aiming to standardize a RESTful protocol for provisioning database objects. The architecture includes support for extensibility, allowing for multiple possible use cases. RPP is intended to co-exist with EPP, offering an alternative protocol including data model compatibility with EPP core objects and the benefits associated with the REST architectural style and widely adopted HTTP-based technologies.</t>

<t anchor="_5f605ad7-6a5f-fd3e-545f-0ba377599158">This document outlines the architecture of the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP). RPP aims to provide a modern, standardised, and developer-friendly protocol for provisioning and managing objects in a shared database or registry, initially focusing on functional equivalents of EPP object mappings for domain names <xref target="RFC5731" section="" relative=""></xref>, hosts <xref target="RFC5732" section="" relative=""></xref>, and contacts <xref target="RFC5733" section="" relative=""></xref>. RPP also considers provisioning of other objects as a potential use case, aiming for a uniform API layer for various registry operations.</t>

<t anchor="_198bc076-8073-b0ec-12a3-56de8858bee6">RPP is designed to leverage the benefits of REST (REpresentational State Transfer), including statelessness, ease of integration, and compatibility with existing web infrastructure and tooling such as OpenAPI, API gateways, and web application firewalls. By adopting JSON as the data-interchange format, RPP seeks to align with current development practices and the successful deployment patterns observed in protocols such as RDAP <xref target="RFC9082" section="" relative=""></xref>. The choice of REST and JSON also facilitates direct browser and mobile application integration including modern security mechanisms such as OAuth2.0.</t>

<t anchor="_b46ec568-e176-ef0c-96fa-20d60d475a55">This architecture document serves as a foundation for a series of specifications that will collectively define RPP. It details the layered approach, core components, and design considerations for building an interoperable and extensible provisioning protocol. RPP is intended to coexist with EPP, offering an alternative for implementers seeking a RESTful approach without aiming to replace EPP or define migration paths from EPP. RPP aims for data model compatibility with EPP core objects to allow automatic and mechanical mapping and conversion, especially for core objects (domain, contact, host).</t>

    <section anchor="_cfefa492-f4ba-f5a9-ca8c-f6a75166648f"><name>Architectural Overview</name>

<t anchor="_db4db913-db84-8378-4cad-0eb22fc8cb8d">This chapter provides an overview of the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) architecture. A key design principle is to leverage existing web standards and principles, particularly HTTP and REST principles. This allows RPP to delegate functionality and features to the well-established infrastructure and semantics of the web, focusing its own definitions on the specific domain of object provisioning. Therefore, we assume:</t>

<ul anchor="_b6a07320-fd99-7354-e86e-828c166c0a80"><li><strong>HTTP and RESTful principles are foundational:</strong> RPP leverages HTTP for transport and adheres to RESTful principles for resource management.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-specific logic resides in data representations:</strong> The specifics of resource provisioning are encoded within the data structures and semantics of the RPP message bodies.</li>
<li><strong>Layered architecture for modularity:</strong> The architecture is layered to promote modularity, separation of concerns, and independent evolution of different aspects of the protocol.</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_7f9968cf-4a82-ddb1-dd89-e505aeb7eb47">The architecture is divided into three main layers: <strong>HTTP Transport</strong>, <strong>Data Representation</strong>, and <strong>Resource Definition</strong>. Each layer defines specific aspects of the protocol. This layered approach allows for clear separation of concerns.</t>

<t anchor="_9c9f0e89-805f-fc1c-8c1d-86d9db505cc7"><strong>Data Structure</strong> is a sub-layer of Data Representation and described later in this document. It focuses on the structure of RPP messages.</t>

<t anchor="_193c6244-d992-200a-00d0-456335bea81f">Similarly <strong>Data Elements</strong>, their <strong>Mapping</strong> onto Data Structure and <strong>Operations</strong> are elements of Resource Definition. They focus on the semantic structure of RPP resources and transformation of those resources.</t>

<section anchor="resource-oriented-architecture"><name>Resource Oriented Architecture</name>

<t anchor="_452e5d79-1866-b0bf-40b4-4f903591598d">RPP adopts a Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA), aligning with RESTful principles. This approach defines all manageable entities as "resources," identified by unique URLs. Operations on these resources are performed through a uniform interface using the standard HTTP methods and their semantics. This contrasts with RPC-style protocols, which often define new and specific operations with custom parameters. ROA promotes a more standardised and interoperable approach, leveraging the existing web infrastructure and its well-defined semantics. Key aspects of ROA within RPP include:</t>

<ul anchor="_3588cb82-6683-e6bc-f771-58c385760f6a"><li><strong>Resource Identification:</strong> Each resource is uniquely identifiable by a URL.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are used to perform operations on resources in a consistent manner.</li>
<li><strong>Operation Singularity</strong> Operations, excluding collection retrieval, are defined to target a single resource. Operations intended to affect multiple resources, such as bulk operations (a single command applied to multiple resources) or command sets (multiple commands on multiple resources), should be modelled through dedicated "batch" or "bulk operation" resources.</li>
<li><strong>Representation:</strong> Resources can be represented in various formats (e.g., JSON, XML) through HTTP standard content negotiation.</li>
<li><strong>Statelessness:</strong> Each request to a resource is treated as independent of previous requests. The server does not maintain client state between requests.</li>
<li><strong>Cacheability:</strong> Responses can be cached to improve performance.</li>

<li><strong>Mapping of basic operations to HTTP uniform interface (verbs):</strong> Mapping CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to POST, HEAD/GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping of operations beyond HTTP uniform interface to URLs and verbs:</strong> Handling more complex operations through appropriate URL structures and HTTP methods.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP response codes:</strong> Utilising standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of requests.</li>
<li><strong>Content negotiation for media types:</strong> Supporting multiple data representation formats and using content negotiation to select the appropriate format.</li>
<li><strong>Caching:</strong> Leveraging HTTP caching mechanisms to improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Language negotiation for textual content:</strong> Supporting multiple languages for textual content and using language negotiation to select the appropriate language.</li>
<li><strong>Representation preferences:</strong> The client may define whether a full representation of an object or only a limited representations is preferred as a response</li>
<li><strong>Validation preferences:</strong> Defining the approach to the input data validation that shall be applied by the server. The server may apply lenient validation where the server makes best effort to process the understood part of the request as opposed to strict processing where the server would reject a request where part of the data is not understood</li>

<t anchor="_dbd2d8e8-f81a-0398-cc59-2da345a3c640">The RPP architecture uses the best practices described in <xref target="RFC9205" section="" relative=""></xref> for the HTTP transport layer.</t>

<section anchor="authentication-authorization"><name>Authentication and Authorisation</name>

<t anchor="_fcfde2ed-58f9-09cd-12dd-3de1e223e9d0">RPP is aimed to leverage scalable and modern authorisation standards, with a focus on OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749" section="" relative=""></xref> and related frameworks. However, to maintain functional equivalence with EPP client authentication, RPP SHOULD also support authentication schemes that can carry a client identifier and a password, such as HTTP Basic Authentication. RPP should be able to support future authentication and authorisation standards defined for HTTP.</t>

<t anchor="_fa0717e6-51fd-9465-45bd-5ac3f6714148">Specifications will define profiles for:</t>

<ul anchor="_186a8e91-6b05-9031-c17b-357b48d4d40c"><li>HTTP Authentication schemes (e.g., HTTP Basic Authentication, Bearer Token <xref target="RFC6750" section="" relative=""></xref> etc.)</li>
<li>Authorisation frameworks (e.g., OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749" section="" relative=""></xref>)</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_8624ceb1-dd36-e300-b361-9e0849af8181">Implementations will be able to choose authentication and authorisation methods appropriate for their security requirements.</t>

<t anchor="_dcf6551f-1e19-af6b-af76-5f673410f1fa">RPP specifications will standardise authorisation scopes (like rpp:read or rpp:write) to define granular access control for different usage scenarios. These scopes will be defined for various operations and resource types, ensuring that clients can be granted only the necessary permissions.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_359db6ab-e2ab-f5b5-1795-5b635ce764c6"><name>Fine-Grained Authorisation</name>

<t anchor="_6254b98c-e895-0e5e-a83e-1c3927fe26cf">RPP authorisation models may become fine-grained, extending beyond simple auth-code based models used in EPP. Authorisation decisions will be able to consider the specific operation being performed (e.g., update vs. read), the resource being accessed (e.g., a specific domain name), and potentially even attributes within the resource.</t>

<t anchor="_ac302653-474b-3a4f-bcd2-91a05993df29">Here solutions like OAuth2 RAR <xref target="RFC9396" section="" relative=""></xref> could be considered to provide fine-grained access control.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_02facde3-4c03-69c8-3d09-a2e2c6ca92ac"><name>Relationship between clients and authentication credentials</name>

<t anchor="_c98e2421-89db-c08f-2ad8-cec436621a06">RPP authentication and authorisation model will make a clear distinction between the login credentials and the authorisation to act in context of a given RPP client. More than one credential might be authorised to act on behalf of the same RPP client. The same credential however must always be assigned to one and only one RPP client context.</t>

<t anchor="_c5dd3882-e012-adeb-2499-4f65f57a550f">In case of HTTP Basic Authentication, one user-id is always bound to at most one RPP client. For OAuth, the issued token is bound to the context of at most one RPP client, even though the OAuth client itself might have access to multiple RPP clients. The assignment of tokens to specific RPP clients can be controlled through the authorisation flow using the OAuth scope parameter. For example, if an OAuth client has access to two RPP clients (Client A and Client B), the scope parameter can specify which client the token applies to. A scope value like <tt>scope=rpp:clientA</tt> would ensure the token is valid only for Client A, while <tt>scope=rpp:clientB</tt> would apply to Client B.</t>

<section anchor="_af05bf66-98cc-9269-feba-9b802bfaec0b"><name>Security</name>

<t anchor="_a878d280-9916-16a9-debc-aacd7f9ddfe1">RPP will not explicitly define security related policies related to authentication or authorisation (such as password complexity, token lifetime or cryptography used) on the protocol level. Instead, these properties will be delegated to the best practices of the chosen authentication schemes, which may evolve over time and would have to be independent of the protocol itself.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_a41342f6-cb24-842e-d422-75a580a87647"><name>Object level authorisation</name>

<t anchor="_596a2682-ba3c-a806-a01b-24b22328be98">RPP will define a mechanism for object-level authorisation, preventing unauthorised access to specific objects or resources. Each object will have an associated sponsor or owner with full control over an object, and the protocol will allow for the specification of which clients are authorised to access or modify non-sponsored/owned objects. This could be achieved through state-of-the-art standards like OAuth authorisation tokens, scopes, and resource-specific permissions but also shared secrets for backward compatibility with EPP password-based authorisation information.</t>

<ul anchor="_ca9f23b4-1de7-d0f9-fba0-0e068e3dea2f"><li>Hierarchical URL structure to represent resources of different types (e.g., <tt>/domains/{domain-name}</tt>, <tt>/contacts/{contact-id}</tt>).</li>
<li>URL structure to represent list of related resources (e.g., <tt>/domains/{domain-name}/contacts/</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_77ff411f-e73e-ed7f-74e3-4f866f2f8e5d">RPP URL structure will be designed to be human-readable, intuitive, and RESTful, allowing clients to easily navigate and interact with resources.</t>

<t anchor="_672acb15-00ae-a0fb-a38f-74681f606ad3">RPP would not require all URLs to be hard wired to server's RPP root URL. Instead, it would allow for relative URLs to be defined and discovered by the client. This would allow servers to distribute resources across multiple servers and URLs and allow for easier scaling as described in <xref target="RFC9205" section="" relative=""></xref>. At the same time the URLs shall be deterministic for the duration of the client session in order to minimise round trips and streamline the interaction.</t>

<t anchor="_48cb9f3f-b7a9-02f5-e1f2-ee7ddc9d1f24">As a matter of extensibility consideration RPP should allow for additional path segments to be added to the URLs and be discoverable by clients.</t>

<t anchor="_413181a9-b513-19b8-0e7e-2ed083819d4a">RPP responses will include URLs for related resources, allowing clients to navigate newly created resources easily. This is similar to the "links" concept in RESTful APIs, where related resources are linked together.</t>

<section anchor="_46f7dec2-e1ed-90b2-748b-65eb10fc575c"><name>Internationalised Domain Names (IDN)</name>

<t anchor="_0d88a59f-67de-6c89-9b03-b8c0e5645d99">RPP will address the handling of Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs) in resource addressing. Specifications will define whether to use IDN or UTF-8 encoding directly in URLs and whether to employ redirects to canonical URLs or "see-also" linking for alternative representations. For example,  a "see-also" link could point from a UTF-8 encoded URL to an IDN URL and vice versa, allowing clients to use either URL. Another way would be to always redirect to the canonical URL, which would be the IDN URL.</t>

<t anchor="_a9be748a-80f1-a5e9-fd50-f26be3597427">RPP operations are mapped to standard HTTP methods to leverage the uniform interface and RESTful principles:</t>

<ul anchor="_44a6007d-6cf8-94b2-653a-d0b845fa48ea"><li><t anchor="_ebefa0f2-fca3-48ac-a2bc-7d448a4068f9"><strong>HEAD:</strong>  Retrieve resource state (e.g., retrieving domain existence information). This may be a candidate for equivalence of EPP check command, however it may come with a few caveats to consider:</t>
<ul anchor="_9fcb7cbd-ec4f-2b01-1568-a62a376d526e"><li>EPP check is intended to check whether (future) resource provisioning is possible. This is not semantically the same as resource state. Overloading HEAD with EPP semantics may lead to confusion, especially as some frameworks implicitly implement HEAD out of GET handling.</li>
<li>a better equivalence of EPP check would be a POST with Expect header, however this header being a reserved header in browsers it may not be availble to all client implementations</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_2e524a22-79ac-5410-f872-ebfad5c4e3a4">The conclusion is that RPP should not overload HTTP HEAD with own semantics, and support HEAD as it is defined in HTTP.</t>
</li>
<li><strong>OPTIONS</strong> RPP shall not define any new semantics for OPTIONS however the specifications should make implementers aware of its role in CORS and pre-flight requests typically made by web browsers</li>
<li><strong>GET:</strong>  Retrieve resource state (e.g., retrieving domain or contact information) - EPP info command</li>
<li><strong>POST:</strong> Create a new resource (e.g., registering a domain or create contact object) - EPP create command</li>
<li><strong>PUT:</strong>  Update an existing resource in its entirety (e.g., updating domain registration details) - not 100% equivalent of EPP update command</li>
<li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Delete a resource (e.g., deleting a domain registration) - EPP delete command</li>
<li><strong>PATCH:</strong>  Partially modify a resource (e.g., updating specific attributes of a domain or contact) - EPP update command</li>

<t anchor="_db6dc717-ab09-5d49-3e0e-82efca88f32e">Many of EPP commands do not map directly to the HTTP uniform interface. RPP will define how to handle these operations using appropriate URL structures and HTTP methods. In order to model additional operations RPP will define an abstraction of process, this being either a transient or a long running operations with state. In both cases such process may accept additional input data as well as have an outcome or result not being part of the resource state itself. Processes shall therefore be modelled as separate sub-resources of the resource being processed, with own uniform interface and set of operations (CRUD).</t>

<t anchor="_0512fa0d-b684-e76b-9ee7-e0d93f645c4e">EPP transfer commands (query and transform), may be modelled by a subresource <tt>/transfer</tt> of the resource being transferred, or a collection <tt>/transfers</tt> with a PUT/POST operation correspondingly to initiate the transfer, GET operation to query the transfer status and POST operation to approve or reject the transfer.</t>

<t anchor="_8c377d92-aed1-4e90-def2-c0f70d661cf6">Other transform operations like renew, or restore which are not directly addressable resources in terms of REST will modelled as a convention of URLs with processing resources with only POST interface, e.g. <tt>/renewal</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_f53412c1-8bae-ffcc-7e2d-e3121c8b9d59">This pattern can be further applied to object operations not defined in the core protocol or EPP, allowing easy and uniform extension of allowed operations.</t>

<t anchor="_a0c8cc78-48e0-4285-5f9e-a597eacfd94f">In order to minimise name collisions between process names and other kind of sub-resources, a distinct path segment shall be dedicated to processes, e.g. <tt>/processes/{process-name}</tt> or <tt>/operations/{operation-name}</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_4fdac72c-5b65-8066-e294-0b6e978c7ef1">The path segments shall be appended to the resource path to create full URI of such processing resource (e.g. <tt>/domains/{domain-name}/processes/renewal</tt> for domain renew operation).</t>

<t anchor="_340dfa6f-f777-87ab-108d-d0bfd4a55d2f">As discussed in <xref target="http-layer-detail-mapping-basic-ops"></xref> EPP check command may not be appropriate to be mapped directly to the HTTP uniform interface of the resource itself. EPP check command will be therefore modelled as sub-resource such as <tt>/availability</tt> offering both HEAD operation for quick yes/no response and GET operation for more detailed response allowing for example to extend on the dataset provided (e.g. pricing information).</t>

<t anchor="_47e6b5a6-c3c4-cd98-07be-15490e11c3a7">This basic set of rules and guidelines will be further refined in the RPP specifications and give a universal toolset for extending RPP with new resources and commands.</t>

<t anchor="_807adc0a-e8c6-0f34-4c1b-4b3d7db6415a">In general RPP shall make use of HTTP status codes to indicate general response status categories (e.g., 2xx success responses, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) <xref target="RFC7231" section="" relative=""></xref> as opposed to responding always 200 if the request was understood even if the operation itself failed.

<t anchor="_72e25eed-862e-341d-ec2a-c1e1f1f2394a">RPP shall use as specific HTTP codes as possible, using generic codes like 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error only if no corresponsing specific code exists (e.g. 404 for not existing resource or 401 for unauthenticated request).</t>

<t anchor="_3c3387b2-1e35-8be0-9741-9f4c78edc414">RPP may utilise the HTTP <tt>Prefer</tt> header <xref target="RFC7240" section="" relative=""></xref> with the "return" preference to allow clients to control the verbosity of responses. For example, clients not interested in full resource representations could use <tt>Prefer: return=minimal</tt> to request minimal responses, reducing payload sizes and improving efficiency. The default behaviour, without the <tt>Prefer</tt> header, would be to return a full resource representation, similar to object info responses in EPP, especially after compound requests are completed. For certain use-cases it might be convenient for a client to receive also dereferenced full or partial representation of related objects. For example details about sponsoring client of domain name instead of just ID. "return" preference syntax alone is not sufficient for this purpose, therefore RPP would need to define custom preference and register it in "HTTP Preferences" IANA registry.</t>

This allows clients to indicate whether they prefer strict validation of message payloads and rejection of requests with unknown properties or a more lenient approach ignoring unknown properties that may allow for additional flexibility in processing.

<section anchor="_ef0cdfd0-4355-a4e8-1169-dcf04506b025"><name>Asynchronous Operation Processing</name>

<t anchor="_aa98b444-59fb-9e95-a7dc-22dddf30f950">The RPP architecture accommodates operations that are potentially long-running or cannot be completed synchronously due to their nature (e.g., acting on multiple objects, resource-intensive tasks, or processes involving manual steps). This is achieved by leveraging standard HTTP mechanisms to provide an asynchronous interaction pattern. This pattern allows a client to initiate an operation and receive an immediate acknowledgement, with the means to check the operation's status and retrieve its outcome at a later point.</t>

<t anchor="_e59e7e6a-f038-1968-e2e1-8169527fd10b">The typical interaction flow facilitated by the architecture is as follows: 1.  A client initiates an operation via an HTTP request. 2.  For operations processed asynchronously, the server typically responds immediately with an appropriate HTTP status code and an indication of a status resource where the client would be able to obtain result of the operation. The resource may be dedicated to the specific performed operation, be a subresource of the resource being processed, or be a separate message queue resource with a stream of operation results. 3.  The server may also provide additional signalling in the response to indicate the expected time for completion or other relevant information using standard HTTP mechanisms. 4.  The representation of the status resource reflects the operation's progress. Once the operation concludes, this representation indicates the final outcome, providing either the results directly, links to the results, or detailed error information in line with RPP's error reporting principles. It shall remain up to protocol design for certain operation and server policy which granularity of status information shall be offered. In some cases it might be sufficient to have one final message, in other cases intermediate statuses might be required. The lifetime of these resources might also be differentiated. Messages in the queue would exist until they are read out by the RPP client. Other status resources might exist for a specific time defined by the server after the processing reached its final state. Finally resources might virtually exist forever or require an explicit delete operation from the client.</t>

<t anchor="_9f23a9a9-a141-8ec3-3205-7f75a6a380c8">This architectural approach to asynchronous operations allows client applications to remain responsive and manage extended processing times effectively, contributing to the overall scalability and robustness of interactions within the RPP ecosystem. Specific RPP operations intended for asynchronous execution will be designed to utilise this pattern.</t>

<section anchor="http-layer-detail-rpp-status-codes"><name>RPP specific status codes and relation to HTTP status codes</name>

<t anchor="_b6589e81-a6e5-315d-5a23-66271c299054">RPP uses a dual-layer approach for signaling operation outcomes, leveraging both standard HTTP status codes and RPP-specific status codes. This allows for compatibility with generic HTTP components while providing detailed, application-level feedback for RPP clients.</t>

<ul anchor="_69b91436-0e6a-bfb4-97cd-c35fe2f1c149"><li>The HTTP status code <xref target="RFC7231" section="" relative=""></xref> must be used to convey the overall outcome of an operation. Any HTTP-aware component, such as a proxy or monitoring tool, can determine if a request was successful (2xx), resulted in a client error (4xx), or a server error (5xx) by inspecting the HTTP status code alone.</li>
<li>RPP-specific status codes, transmitted in a dedicated HTTP header, must be used to provide granular, application-level information about the operation's result.</li>
<li>RPP responses must include both an HTTP status code and an RPP-specific status code, however in some cases request handling may be terminated already on HTTP level, for example due malformed HTTP message, in such cases only HTTP status code will be present.</li>
<li>RPP-specific status codes should be mapped to the most semantically appropriate HTTP status code. For example, an RPP status code indicating "object already exists" during a creation attempt should map to HTTP 409 (Conflict), while a code for "object does not exist" during a lookup should map to HTTP 404 (Not Found). If no specific HTTP status code is a good semantic fit, a generic code (e.g., 400 for a general client-side business rule failure, 200 for a successful operation with additional information) should be used.</li>
<li>This mechanism applies to both successful and unsuccessful operations. A successful response (e.g., HTTP 200 OK) may include an RPP-specific header to provide additional information, such as warnings, deprecation notices, or details about a partial success.</li>
<li>In the case of an error, the response body should contain a machine-readable problem details document <xref target="RFC9457" section="" relative=""></xref> to provide further information about the error.</li>
<li>RPP status codes should be categorised as either temporary or permanent to guide client retry behaviour.</li>
<li>RPP should also use other standardised HTTP signaling mechanisms where appropriate, for example for rate limiting.</li>

<t anchor="_bf84a443-1eff-6f0e-6680-70474d030b55">Client provided identifier shall be returned in the corresponding synchronous response and shall be included in the asynchronous responses.

<li>Advertising supported protocol versions, extensions, available resource types, authentication methods, and supported features.</li>
<li>It may be considered for RPP to distribute service discovery for each resource type separately for better scalability and management. For example instead of having a single service discovery endpoint for the whole registry on <tt>/.well-known/rpp-capabilities</tt> there might be a separate discovery placed under <tt>/{resource-type}/.well-known/rpp-capabilities</tt> e.g. <tt>/domains/.well-known/rpp-capabilities</tt>.</li>
<li>Service discovery shall utilise standardised methods, like URI templates <xref target="RFC6570" section="" relative=""></xref> to allow easy navigation of resources and avoid hard-coding of URLs, same time allowing clients to navigate directly to a known resource without additional server queries.</li>

<section anchor="extension-mechanisms"><name>Extension mechanisms</name>

<t anchor="_54e612c4-c5b3-a841-0877-f5ed0ff86fc3">The RPP architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new resource types, data elements, and operations without breaking existing implementations. This extensibility is achieved through:</t>

<ul anchor="_3d77804c-b9ba-e8bf-33f0-383db3fe8bac"><li><strong>Layered Design:</strong> Each architectural layer (HTTP Transport, Data Representation, Resource Definition) is defined independently, allowing new features or technologies to be introduced at one layer without impacting others.</li>
<li><strong>IANA Registries:</strong> Resource types, data elements, mappings, and operations are registered in IANA registries using machine-readable formats. This enables automated processing, discovery, and extension of protocol elements without requiring changes to the core specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Resource and Operation Extension:</strong> New resource types and operations can be defined and registered. Existing resources can be extended with additional data elements or operations in a backward-compatible manner.</li>
<li><strong>Profile and Compatibility Layers:</strong> Compatibility profiles can be defined to support subsets of RPP for specific use cases (such as EPP compatibility)</li>
<li><strong>Discovery and Negotiation:</strong> Service discovery endpoints and content negotiation mechanisms allow clients and servers to dynamically discover and utilise new capabilities, resource types, and representations as they are introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Status codes:</strong> New RPP status codes can be defined and registered including their mapping to HTTP status codes.</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_d209bfc3-65c0-da06-a462-e57707864e81">RPP shall facilitate standardisation and reuse by requiring that extensions be registered with IANA. These registration requirements shall be fine-grained, applying independently to protocol elements such as resource types, data elements, operations, and status codes. This approach promotes consistency and interoperability, avoids fragmentation from conflicting definitions, and allows protocol elements to evolve independently.</t>

<t anchor="_6460b8ee-b6c4-4535-169a-e2e2c426764d">These extensibility mechanisms ensure that RPP can evolve to meet future requirements, integrate with emerging technologies, and support a wide range of provisioning scenarios while maintaining interoperability and stability.</t>

<section anchor="_030edd87-fb9d-9494-d41c-4b920182c62a"><name>Name Management and Collision Avoidance</name>

<t anchor="_dd42f428-52be-fbc8-78bf-c4a4f3e65c8b">RPP extensions MUST define unique names for all extension elements to prevent conflicts with other extensions and with core protocol elements. These names are used consistently in resource identifiers, data element identifiers, and URL path segments.</t>

<t anchor="_11553301-4557-29df-9694-747d17243e51">Standardised RPP extensions MUST register their names in a dedicated IANA registry for RPP extensions to ensure global uniqueness and avoid collisions. Private (non-standardised) extensions are also required to use unique names, but are not required to register with IANA. This allows private extensions to be developed and used within specific implementations or organisations without impacting the global RPP ecosystem. Private extensions should use names that are unlikely to conflict with other extensions or with RPP core elements, for example by using reverse domain notation as a prefix (e.g., <tt>org.example.rpp</tt>).</t>

<t anchor="_4ee34611-7fa5-3f82-6f3b-5990fbda3025">This naming mechanism ensures that new resource types, data elements, and operations can be introduced independently and safely, supporting the extensibility goals of the RPP architecture while maintaining interoperability and clarity across implementations.</t>
